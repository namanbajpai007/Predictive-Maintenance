### Dataset Description

The dataset consists of multiple multivariate time series data collected from engines. Each engine starts with different initial wear and variation, which is normal and not considered a fault. There are three operational settings affecting engine performance. The data includes sensor noise.

- **Engine Operation**: Each engine starts normally and develops a fault during the series. The training data shows fault growth until failure, while the test data ends before failure.
- **Objective**: The goal is to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the engine before failure based on sensor readings and operational settings.
  
**Data Sets:**
- **FD001**: 100 training trajectories, 100 test trajectories, Sea Level conditions, and one fault mode (HPC Degradation).
- **FD002**: 260 training trajectories, 259 test trajectories, six conditions, and one fault mode (HPC Degradation).
- **FD003**: 100 training trajectories, 100 test trajectories, Sea Level conditions, and two fault modes (HPC Degradation, Fan Degradation).
- **FD004**: 248 training trajectories, 249 test trajectories, six conditions, and two fault modes (HPC Degradation, Fan Degradation).

The data consists of 26 columns: 
1. Unit number 
2. Time (cycles) 
3. Operational settings (3 columns) 
4. Sensor measurements (26 columns).
